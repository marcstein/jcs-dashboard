DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO DISMISS FOR FAILURE TO STATE A CLAIM

COMES NOW Defendant, {{defendant_name}}, by and through counsel, and pursuant to Rule 55.27(a)(6), moves this Court to dismiss Plaintiff's Petition for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and in support thereof states as follows:

STATEMENT OF FACTS

1. Plaintiff filed the above-captioned action on {{filing_date}}.

2. Plaintiff's Petition purports to assert a claim for {{cause_of_action}}.

ARGUMENT

I. STANDARD FOR MOTION TO DISMISS

3. A motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim tests the adequacy of the plaintiff's petition. A petition must contain "a short and plain statement of the facts showing that the pleader is entitled to relief." Rule 55.05.

4. When ruling on a motion to dismiss, the Court must accept all properly pleaded facts as true and determine whether the facts alleged and the reasonable inferences therefrom state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Nazeri v. Missouri Valley College, 860 S.W.2d 303, 306 (Mo. banc 1993).

II. PLAINTIFF'S PETITION FAILS TO STATE A CLAIM

5. {{deficiency_description}}

{{#specific_elements_missing}}
6. Specifically, the Petition fails to allege:
   {{specific_elements_missing}}
{{/specific_elements_missing}}

7. Because Plaintiff's Petition fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for {{cause_of_action}}, Defendant is entitled to dismissal.

CONCLUSION

WHEREFORE, Defendant respectfully requests this Court enter an Order dismissing Plaintiff's Petition for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and for such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,
